// DIY Exercise3_4

    // Find the maximum between two long integers.
    // Let's also do the following:
    // • Let's use only one scanf() function.
    // • Let's use ternary (conditional) operator.
    // • Let's reduce the number of variables used in the program.
    // Your program should have the following output:
    // Input two long integers: 8 3
    // The maximum between 8 and 3 is 8

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

    int x;
    int y;
    
    printf("Input two long integers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);

    (x > y) ? printf("The maximum between %d and %d is %d", x, y, x) : printf("The maximum between %d and %d is %d", x, y, y);
    
    return 0;
}
